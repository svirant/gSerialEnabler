# Ordering PCBs
PCBs for this project:
 - [gSerial Enabler](https://github.com/svirant/gSerialEnabler/blob/main/gSerial_Enabler.zip)
 - [VGA Adapter](https://github.com/svirant/DonutDongle/tree/main/Adapters) (VGAPassthrough or YC2VGA)
 
There are plenty of options for PCB manufacturing but I prefer [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) (No affiliation). Using the gerber (.zip) files provided, it's easy to place an order. Below are some tips/guidelines:
- 1.6mm Thickness
- For Surface Finish, "HASL(with lead)" is fine
- 4 Layer PCBs are the same cost as 2 Layer for the VGA Adapters. Because of that, the inner 2 layers are being used as ground planes for better EMI protection. Thanks to https://x.com/zaxour for the idea!
- "Remove Mark" option is now free on JLCPCB. Use it!
- All remaining default options should be fine
- Let me know if you have any questions!

# Programming an Arduino Nano
I recommend the [Official Arduino IDE and guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide) if you're unfamiliar with Arduinos. All .ino files used for programming are listed above. 

Some Arduino Nanos come with an Old Bootloader and won't Upload unless specified. **If you get errors** when trying to upload, swap to this option as a possible fix.

# How to Use
- Make sure **"Auto Load SVS"** is **"On"** under the RT4K Profiles menu.  
- The RT4K checks the **/profile/SVS** subfolder for profiles and need to be named: **S\<input number>_\<user defined>.rt4**  For example, SVS input 2 would look for a profile that is named S2_SNES.rt4.  If thereâ€™s more than one profile that fits the pattern, the first match is used.

- Check the RT4K Diagnostic Console for Serial commands being received as confirmation.


## SVS Profile numbering scheme

**Input 1-8 = 201 - 208**

The "offset" option can be used if using multiple gSerial Enablers connected to the RT4K via a headphone splitter. If using a 2nd, change to "offset = 8" for the 2nd to be SVS profiles 209 - 216.

```
uint16_t const offset = 0; // Only needed for multiple gSerial Enablers. Set offset so 2nd, 3rd, etc gSEs don't overlap profiles. (e.g. offset = 8;) 
```
